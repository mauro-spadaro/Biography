Ciao, I'm Mauro Spadaro. Here some things about me:

🚀 I am currently working in a Sequoia-backed Swiss start-up named Yokoy as a Product Manager. In this role I took part to more and less technical initiatives, like shipping a Public API to build internal tooling to scale operations.

🤖 Economist by education, technologist by passion. I like to try out things myself, you can see here in Github some of the projects I have worked on.

✈️ My journey in Product started with Zaefiro, a no-code flight-sharing portal started with a friend in 2021.

💻 Before working in Product, I tried different things in various industries. In 2020, I contributed launching a no-profit consulting platform called Thrive.

🤝🏻 Since April 2022 I am Community Coordinator for the Fintech Product Guild, a community of 100+ senior fintench product people, acrooss Europe and US.

🕹️ I have a blog (speaktheproductup.com) where I talk about some of the things that interest me the most. From product management to personal life.
